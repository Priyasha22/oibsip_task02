            <p>Swami Vivekananda, originally named Narendranath Datta, was born on January 12, 1863, in Calcutta,British
                India (now Kolkata, India). He was a renowned Indian Hindu monk and a key figure in introducing Indian
                philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world. Vivekananda's life and teachings have had a
                profound impact on the spiritual and intellectual landscape of India and beyond.
                Narendranath's quest for spiritual truth led him to meet the prominent saint and mystic, Sri Ramakrishna
                Paramahamsa, at the age of 18. Sri Ramakrishna recognized the spiritual potential in Narendranath and
                became his guru. Under the guidance of Ramakrishna, Narendranath delved deeply into the study of various
                spiritual disciplines,including Advaita Vedanta.
                On July 4, 1902, Swami Vivekananda attained Mahasamadhi, leaving behind an enduring legacy that
                continues to inspire countless individuals worldwide. His teachings continue to be studied, discussed,
                and followed by spiritual seekers, scholars, and philosophers around the globe, making him one of the
                most influential spiritual leaders of modern times. Swami Vivekananda's life serves as a beacon of
                light, guiding humanity towards a path of knowledge, compassion, and selfless service.

            <p>After the passing of his guru, Narendranath embarked on a profound spiritual journey. He embraced a life
                of renunciation, wandering across India as a wandering monk, seeking to understand the diverse cultural
                and religious traditions of his country. During these travels, he witnessed the poverty and suffering of
                the masses, which deeply affected him and instilled in him a strong desire to serve humanity.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>In 1893, Swami Vivekananda represented Hinduism at the Parliament of the World's Religions in
                    Chicago. His opening address, beginning with the words "Sisters and Brothers of America," received a
                    standing ovation and garnered widespread admiration. This historic speech introduced the world to
                    the rich spiritual heritage of India and emphasized the idea of religious tolerance and universal
                    acceptance.</li>
                <li>
                    On his return to India with a small group of Western disciples in 1897, Vivekananda founded the
                    Ramakrishna Mission at the monastery of Belur Math on the Ganges (Ganga) River near Calcutta (now
                    Kolkata). Self-perfection and service were his ideals, and the order continued to stress them. He
                    adapted and made relevant to the 20th century the very highest ideals of the Vedantic religion, and,
                    although he lived only two years into that century, he left the mark of his personality on East and
                    West alike.
                </li>
                <li>He was an open-minded person whose sublime message in all his teachings was nationalism. He spread
                    the knowledge of Yoga and all the forms mentioned in the Patanjali Sutras. He also accompanied
                    Jamsetji Tata in his travels and inspired him to set up an educational institute focused on
                    research.</li>

                <li>
                    He visited the UK and the US again and during his second visit set up the Vedanta Societies, meant
                    to be a peace retreat in San Francisco and many ashrams. He always incorporated the teachings of the
                    Bhagavad Gita in his speeches and tried to enlighten people with the meaning of Karma Yoga which is
                    the path of life to follow. He believed in the philosophy of doing good to others and that divinity
                    is supreme and divinity resides in each soul. His incredible legacy is still remembered and
                    followed.
                </li>
                <li>His famous quotes was :
                    Do not lower your goals to the level of your abilities. Instead, raise your abilities to the height
                    of your goals.

                    Everything is easy when you are busy. But nothing is easy when you are lazy.
